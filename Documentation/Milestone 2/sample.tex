\chapter{Introduction} 

In our milestone 1 document, we introduced our plans to develop a system that reminds dementia patients to use their walking aids should we detect that they are walking without them. We discussed this issue with our client, Bangor Health Clinic, to finalise our list of requirements to ensure that we were able to develop an adequate system. Within that document, we also detailed our schedule for project development along with an in-depth risk analysis that outlined potential risks to our project along with a matrix that set out the likelihood of each detailed risk occurring and the severity of impact the risks would have on our project.

It has been three months since the submission of that document on December 14th, where the project has progressed since then, both in terms of development and the understanding of the task at hand for our team. This document will outline the progress that has been made by our team since then, including detail of the work undertaken to finalise a parts list that would allow us to meet the requirements specified in milestone 1, and how the procurement of these parts has led to a delay in the commencing of software and embedded system development. We will detail the progress we have made in software development towards creating a walking detection system, which currently consists of 2 working prototypes that utilise different principals to count the steps taken when the patient is moving, as well as a communication system that allows our wearable and walking aid device to communicate with each other. Along with the progress made in software development, we will also outline the progress we  made in our understanding of the system when researching potential implementations of the walking detection system. Finally, we will detail if any amendments need to be made to our schedule and risk analysis sections from milestone 1 due reasons such as; the occurrence of impacting risks such as delays in the procurement of hardware, the effects of health conditions and other curricular activities on the productivity levels of our team, and the lack of proactive effort from team members.

\section{The Project}

Our planned system comprised of two TinyPICO boards, one being worn by the patient and the other being attached to their walking aid. We then specified our plans to utilise a tri-axial accelerometer to detect the patient walking when they are wearing our device. When walking is detected, we specified that the wearable device would communicate with the walking aid device to identify whether or not the walking aid was also moving. Here we declared to use a second tri-axial accelerometer to identify if the walking aid was indeed moving. If we detect that the patient is moving without their walking aid, then the walking aid device would play a message, recorded by the patient's relative or carer, to remind the patient to take their walking aid with them. To implement the reminder feature, we declared the need to utilise an I2S audio shield that would read a recorded message from an SD card and send the message to be output by a connected external speaker. The implementation of the reminder feature also needed to account for potential patients that may have suffered from hearing loss. To account for this, we also stated the necessity of including a vibration motor within our wearable device that would vibrate to remind the patient to take their walking aid with them, rather than utilising the speaker within the device attached to the walking aid. Finally, we discussed a stretch-requirement, which would be implemented if our time and financial constraints allowed. This requirement was a free-fall detection feature that would be able to detect the fall of a patient in a similar fashion to the leading smart watch devices \cite{samsung_watch, apple_watch}.

\section{Related Work}

The consequences of falls among elderly patients suffering with dementia is well documented, with falls often leading to an increase in fractures suffered by the patients \cite{buchner_1987}, and unfortunately also being a major cause of mortality \cite{shaw_2007}. Along with the clear dangers of falls within the community of elderly patients suffering with dementia, a 1993 study of falls within a nursing home for elderly patients with dementia noted a "rate of about 4 falls per person per year" \cite{van_dijk_meulenberg_van_de_sande_habbema_1993}. When noting the staggering figures of falls suffered per year within a nursing home caring for elderly patients with dementia, it is clear to see why this project provides a strong motivation for us to create a strong product that can be beneficial to this area of medical care. Due to limited development of solutions in this area, by reason of Bangor Health Clinic reaching out to us to help develop this solution, we still strongly feel that what we can provide with a bespoke system far outweighs the gains that can be had from utilising off-the-shelf technology. 

Due to a lack of similar solutions that explicitly solve the problem we are trying to solve, we needed to research further tracking devices such as the Tile ecosystem to identify similar solutions that may use hardware technologies that could be beneficial to our project. Tile is an ecosystem of tracking products that allow buyers to attach devices to their valuables and utilise the Tile mobile application so that the Tile devices ring to notify the user of where their lost valuable is. Tile utilises Bluetooth Low Energy technology to allow the user to connect their Tile devices with their smart phones on demand \cite{hall_2021}. The ESP32 chips found on our TinyPICO devices also allow the use of Bluetooth Low Energy technology, and has provided us with an interesting option for communication between our devices. Further discussion on our chosen technology to provide communication between our TinyPICO devices will be provided later in this document. Tile builds on top of their implementation of their mobile application by partnering with smart home companies such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa \cite{hall_2021}, to allow users to use their voice to help locate their lost valuables. 

Competing technologies with the Tile ecosystem include Apple's newest tracking technology, the AirTag, along with Samsung's equivalent, the Galaxy SmartTag. Apple utilise ultra-wideband technology in order to facilitate the communication protocol between their mobile phone devices and their AirTag devices \cite{griffith_2021}. "Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology is loosely defined as any wireless transmission scheme that occupies a bandwidth of more than 25\% of a center frequency" \cite{Foerster_ultra-widebandtechnology}, with it being used for short distance communication \cite{uwb}. With leading technology companies such as Apple opting to use ultra-wideband technology, we felt it appropriate to also consider using this technology within our own communication system, with its adequate range of up to 200 metres \cite{bleesk}. Ultra-wideband technology also offers distance measuring features as accurate as 10 centimetres \cite{bleesk}, providing us with a further consideration for technologies that could be used for walking detection in the wearable device. More on this later in this document. 

The common downsides to the use of these products in combating the issue we aim to solve, is that they are all tracking devices of sorts. All products make use of a single hardware device system, which in turn communicates with a mobile device to allow the user to locate their lost valuable item. Whilst this would be ideal for helping a patient locate their walking aid, it would not provide reminders to the patient to use their walking aid. Further issues with these devices is that some use alarm sound systems to locate the user's valuables. A clear requirement set out by the client was that our device should not make use of generic alarm systems, to avoid startling the patient. This is why we feel a bespoke system here would be most beneficial. 

\chapter{Current Progress}

Within this chapter we will detail the progress we have made towards completing the product set out to be developed within this project. This chapter will consist of a section detailing what work was carried out prior to the submission of our milestone 1 document on December 14th, and what work has been carried out since then. We will also detail any issues that we have faced along the way that may have hampered the progress we wanted to make and may have impacted upon the schedule we detailed in our milestone 1 document. 

\section{Progress Prior to Milestone 1}

Prior to the submission of our milestone 1 document, we had held 2 meetings with our client to gain an understanding of the user requirements for the project and to clarify details within project management such as the budget we were assigned and if the client had any preferences towards what hardware we should use to develop our product. 

We held an introductory meeting with the client on the 18th of November, which allowed us to clarify what issue the client wanted to solve and what system the client desired to be built to solve said issue. Unfortunately, we left the meeting feeling unsatisfied as we had failed to gain a full understanding of the final direction the client wanted the project to go down. We were left with two options; to develop a non-wearable device, such as a pressure pad system, to detect when the patient had left their resting area, or to develop a wearable device that would constantly poll an accelerometer to detect the patient walking. The client kindly agreed to offer us a budget of £150 to aid with the procurement of hardware devices that were a necessity for developing the product depending on the route we decided to take the project down. 

Due to the fact that we had left the introductory meeting without a clear set of final user requirements, we held an intra-team meeting to decide upon which solution we would prefer to develop as a team, both based on the skills we posses in code development and engineering, as well as what we felt would be most beneficial to solving the problem at hand. We ultimately decided to develop a product that included the wearable device. We decided on this solution as we felt that it offered the best platform to incorporate stretch features, such as fall detection in future. It also avoids some clear disadvantages from using a pressure pad system such as a carer needing to move the pressure pad to each piece of furniture the patient rests on, and creating a water proof solution that means that the pressure pad can be easily cleaned. 

Once we had clarified the route we wanted to take the project down, we scheduled a second meeting with the client for the 25th of November to discuss our decision with them. The client agreed with our reasoning for developing a wearable device and were content for the project to continue in this manner. We finalised a final budget of £150 and the client stated that they did not have any preference for hardware to be used within the development of this system. We agreed with the client that we would develop a list of functional and non-functional requirements for them to agree to or amend where they saw fit, and would include them within the submission of our milestone 1 document. Our next steps from here were to complete the milestone 1 document, and finalise a list of hardware devices that were necessary for the development of the system we had in mind. Once we had finalised a list of hardware devices to procure, we needed to submit them to the client for ordering so that we could begin code development.
