\chapter{Testing}
\label{ch:testing}

    This chapter will detail the acceptance testing that the group carried out in order to confirm that the developed prototype adheres to the user requirements and specification that the client previously accepted in our Milestone 1 document. The chapter will be split into test cases for the different areas of the developed system. For example, a section on the test cases that specifically tested the efficiency of the systems' load times. Each test case will be assigned its own test code for ease of reference, along with a list of requirements or specifications it helps to meet, a description of the test case itself, a brief description of the acceptance criteria and the result of the test case. Despite the fact that the Milestone 1 document included an agreed user requirement and specification section, we have since come to realise that import specifications and requirements were omitted from that document. This is due to the fact that as we developed code, we gained a deeper understanding of the task at hand and further specifications and requirements became apparent. In the case that a test case aims to help solve a requirement or specification that was not included in Milestone 1, we will detail the requirement or specification in full.

    \section{System Boot}
    \label{sec:test_boot}

        This section will include the test cases that tested the behaviour of the system when booting, more specifically the speed of initial boot and how the system notifies the user that it is powered on.

    \section{System Initialisation}
    \label{sec:test_init}

        System initialisation handles the initialisation and configuration of hardware components connected to each of the walking aid and wearable devices. Within this section, we will include test cases that test the functionality of the system when initialisation errors are encountered, as well as efficiency testing of the systems when performing initialisation tasks.
