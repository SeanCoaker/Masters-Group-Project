    \hline
    \textbf{Assert Specification(s):} The wearable device should boot from power on without delay.\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Description:} This test ensures that the wearable device should power on without significant delay when the prototype is connected via USB to the developer's computer system. This simulates the device being powered on with the recharging or replacements of batteries in future.\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The wearable device should boot on power on without delay.
            \item From boot, the wearable device should instantly begin the initialisation of necessary hardware components.
