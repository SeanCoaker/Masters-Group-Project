    \textbf{Test Case:} TEST\_WEARABLE\_WALK02\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Assert Specification(s):} FREQ1: The wearable device should detect when a patient has walked more than 1 metre before communicating with the walking aid.\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Description:} This test ensures that the wearable device detects when the user has walked more than 1 metre before communicating with the walking aid device.\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The wearable device should send a message to the walking aid device when the user has walked more than 5 steps in a 10 second period.
        \end{itemize}\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Result:} \colorbox{Dandelion}{PARTIAL PASS}\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Reason:} In normal walking conditions, the wearable device sends a message to the walking aid device after walking over 1 metre. However, the same issue flagged in TEST_WEARABLE_01 can be identified here. That is, should the user move the wearable device with enough force, steps will be detected even without them walking. This issue can be limited with adjustments to thresholds and through wearing of the device on the ankle.\\
