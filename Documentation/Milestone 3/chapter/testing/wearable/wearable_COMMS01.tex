    \begin{itemize}
        \item FREQ1: The wearable device should detect when a patient has walked more than 1 metre before communicating with the walking aid.
        \item FREQ5: The wearable device should communicate to the
        walking aid device to let it know when it's started
        moving.
    \end{itemize}\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Description:} This test ensures that the wearable device attempts to send a message to the walking aid device should more than 5 steps be detected in a 10 second period.\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The wearable device should broadcast a message to the walking aid device if it detects more than 5 steps in a 10 second period.
        \end{itemize}\\
