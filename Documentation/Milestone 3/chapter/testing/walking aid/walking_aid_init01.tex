    \textbf{Test Case:} TEST\_WALKING\_AID\_INIT01\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Assert Specification(s):} The walking aid device should boot from power on without delay.\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Description:} This test ensures that the walking aid device should power on without significant delay when the prototype is connected via USB to the developer's computer system. This simulates the device being powered on with the recharging or replacements of batteries in future.\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The walking aid device should boot on power on without delay.
            \item From boot, the walking aid device should instantly begin the initialisation of necessary hardware components.
        \end{itemize}\\
