    \textbf{Test Case:} TEST\_WALKING\_AID\_COMMS01\\

    \textbf{Assert Specification(s):} FREQ3: The wearable device should include a solution for deaf people that still reminds them to take their walking aid with them without the need for an audio alarm.\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Description:} This test ensures that the walking aid device attempts to send a message to the wearable device to vibrate should a reminder need to be played but the user is hard of hearing.\\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The walking aid device should broadcast a message to the wearable device if the wearable should vibrate.
        \end{itemize}\\
