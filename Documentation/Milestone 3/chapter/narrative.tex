\chapter{Narrative and Reflective Account}
\label{ch:narrative}

    In this chapter, we will provide a detailed narrative and reflective account as well as a perspective on the entire process of developing the Walking Aid Usage Prompt System. Specifically, in this chapter, we will describe the development process, from the beginning to the end, along with all the problems we encountered, and how we solved them.

    \section{Narrative Account}
    \label{sec:narrative_account}

        The following section will detail a narrative account of the process of developing this project. We will begin by evaluating the final progress of the project against the requirements we specified in our Milestone 1 document \cite{coaker}, before moving onto discuss the problems we faced during project development and how we attempted to overcome those problems. Finally, we will provide a conclusion of how the project went and what we learned from it.

        \subsection{Evaluating the Project}
        \label{subsec:evaluation}

            This section will evaluate whether the project was a success or not by listing our requirements from our Milestone 1 document \cite{coaker}, and comparing them to the final progress of the project. We will detail whether those requirements have been met and why, before concluding the section with a body of text that evaluates our overall satisfaction with the outcome of the project. The listed requirements will also include some requirements that were omitted from the Milestone 1 document \cite{coaker} and were identified later into the project's lifecycle. The list of requirements, progress made to fulfill those requirements, and the details behind how that progress was made is listed below.

            Due to the evaluation of the progress towards requirements above, we feel that we have completed this project and all the requirements that were necessary to be completed by the project deadline. We are aware that a stretch goal was not managed to be completed prior to the project deadline, however this is a stretch goal and was not necessary to be completed by the project deadline. Because of this, we feel that the project is complete.

        \subsection{Problems and Solutions}
        \label{subsec:probs_solutions}

            This section will discuss the problems that we faced during the development of this project, with respect to the schedule specified in Milestone's 1 and 2 \cite{coaker, mile2}, our identified risks and problems we faced due to our assigned team roles and the methodology we decided to adhere to for the development of this project. 

            \subsubsection{Schedule}

                In our Milestone 1 document \cite{coaker}, we laid out a timeplan and schedule that we would aim to follow to ensure that the project was completed on time. We were given feedback on this schedule that stated that our assigned time to each sprint was far too long and needed to be shortened to allow for easier planning of feature development and document writing. This turned out to be the case and caused many issues with the initial progress of the project. The biggest issue caused by this was the fact that our team was not proactive enough in the writing of the Milestone 1 document, the ordering of hardware and the development of designs for the overall system. Those designs could have been created far earlier in the project's lifecycle and included within this document. A Gantt chart of our schedule specified in Milestone 1 can be viewed in figure \ref{fig:ganttm1} and demonstrates the original planned sprints that ultimately caused us issues.

                \input{graphics/ganttm1.tex}
                
                We attempted to solve these issues by trying to order our hardware after the Christmas period and by attempting to complete our Milestone 1 document within a week of the deadline. Had we made our sprints shorter, we could have created a more pro-active mindset within the team to complete these pieces of work sooner and ultimately save time to develop the project further in future. To ensure that we did not face these issues for the remaining time of the project, we decided to make our sprints shorter for the Gantt chart schedule that we included in our Milestone 2 document \cite{mile2}. This Gantt chart demonstrates the concsious effort we made to shorten our sprints and attempt to create a more pro-active mindset within the team by encouraging the team to advance the project sufficiently for each sprint deadline. Figure \ref{fig:ganttm2} demonstrates this Gantt chart.

                \input{graphics/ganttm2.tex}

                Upon adjusting our second Gantt chart, we noticed that our team was more actively attempting to progress the project with each passing sprint. Having said this, it would be interesting to monitor the activity of the team had both schedules been compared at similar stages of the project's lifecycle. We say this as it is a fair assumption that the project might also have progressed more consistently in the latter stages of its lifecycle due to the fact that the team were more pressured as the project deadline approached.

            \subsubsection{Hardware Procurement}

                As mentioned in our previous Milestone 2 document \cite{mile2}, we experienced delays in the procurement of hardware devices necessary to develop the project. These delays resulted in the delays of beginning code development, which ultimately left us in a position of having limited time to complete the project and not enough time to test all the potential technologies that we could have used. Hardware delivery delays occurred due to the complex process required to be completed to order hardware through the University, as well as courier delays taking place. Having said this, we could have limited the likelihood of this issue occurring by having the team prioritise the hardware procurement process earlier in the lifecycle of the project. Ultimately, we should have foreseen potential delays over the Christmas and New Year period, and ensured that we had our hardware orders sorted before the University closed for Christmas. 

                Without the benefits of hindsight, we attempted to complete the work we could complete without the full hardware inventory which allowed us to save time later on in the project lifecycle to develop the other features. As we already had an inventory of 2 TinyPICO boards, we were able to implement the communication protocol whilst waiting for the delivery of the full hardware inventory. This meant that when the full inventory was delivered, we could focus our attentions to the develop of the other features, such as movement detection and the audio system in the walking aid device. This solution worked well and certainly eased the pressure when developing the other features of our systems. However, had we managed to order our hardware earlier, we could have started to implement the stretch goals supplied to us that would have advanced the project to the next level.

    \section{Requirements and Topic}
    \label{sec:reqs}

    The first thing we did was to arrange a meeting with the client, who in this case was a representative of Bangor Health Clinic. The reason for this meeting is to understand better the topic and also gather the requirements from the client. At first, we thought of two possible outcomes, according to the client's requirements, developing a wearable device or a non-wearable device. The first one is a device similar to a watch that will include an accelerometer, which will be responsible for calculating the user's movement, and the second one is a pressure pad, that will detect when the user is sitting or not to it. We proposed to Bangor Health Clinic, the first solution rather than the second, as the second might need extra information to calculate the user's movement, for instance, if the user stands up there is no way of understanding if the user is walking, or creating a solution in which the pad can be easily cleaned up. All of these reasons were also very difficult for us to implement, so we chose the first solution as it is the more passable solution when it comes to our skills.

    \section{Development}
    \label{sec:development}

    The next step is the development of the proposed solution, including the methodology we followed. The development of the Walking Aid System was tough for our team, to complete in time, as we lost valuable time at the beginning of the project while waiting for the proper equipment to arrive. Fortunately, we moved the project forward in both software and hardware development, developing prototypes, after their arrival. The loss of that time was something from which our timetable could never recover. Although we realized that working on a project that includes both software and hardware development may necessitate additional time, the delivery and arrival of the equipment may take extra time; therefore, the project plan must be adaptable to those dates. The development is split into three sections, the first section contains all the problems we encountered for the software development, the second section contains all the problems we encountered for the hardware development, and the final one contains all the problems we encountered for the risk analysis. Each section will highlight how we solved the problem if it was solved, and what we learnt from that solution.

    \subsection{Software Development}
    \label{ssec:software}

    Working on this type of project that requires software and hardware development was very challenging for us, especially when it comes to hardware selection, which was the first problem we faced. Because the initial budget we required exceeded the one allocated by the customer, we devised a method to reduce the ordering budget by borrowing two TinyPICOs from the University. Having now all the equimpent we needed to find a solution on how these two systems will communicate with each other. Choosing a communication protocol was a key challenge since we required one that would not exceed our budget while still being extremely precise at a long-range. As a result, we chose the ESP-Now protocol for communication between our TinyPICOs since it is simple to integrate with ESP32 chips and has a range of 220 meters.

    \subsection{Risk Analysis}
    \label{ssec:}

    % What problems we encountered while defining risks
    When we defined our risks in Milestone 1 \cite{coaker}, we ran into issues with our budget and hardware procurement, which caused us to lose development time as mentioned in the previous section \ref{sec:development}. However, in Milestone 2 \cite{mile2}, we revised our risks because the loss of development time was still affecting our schedule, so we needed to conduct team meetings so we could oversee the project's progress, whether we were still behind schedule or not.

    \section{Reflection}
    \label{sec:Reflection}

    From this group project, the first thing we learnt from developing a project for a client is that working in groups is very difficult, especially when not all members contribute at the same level. This is something that happened in this project, as some members did not pull their weight, resulting in many incomplete tasks being left to be completed at the last minute. This might have happened since everyone's schedules were different, but it doesn't imply it's not a reasonable reason for everyone's workload. Of course, if all of the team members were equally devoted to this project, we would have greater outcomes and not have as much work to do near the finish.

    Needless to say, given this was a group project, we had to hold meetings to maintain track of the project's development. Using Discord for our meetings eased and simplified things for us. In addition, we used GitHub, which improved our git expertise and made it easy for us to divide the documentation work and all of the project's work in general.

    Although, this project gave us the chance to implement software engineering principles we learnt through the years of our studies, such as software design, choosing a proper methodology, developing a project plan and also working as a team.
