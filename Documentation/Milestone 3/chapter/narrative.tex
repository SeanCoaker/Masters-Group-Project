\chapter{Narrative and Reflective Account}
\label{ch:narrative}

    In this chapter we will provide a detailed narrative andd reflective account as well as a perspective on the entire process of developing the Walking Aid Usage Prompt System. Specifically, in this chapter we will describe all the development process, from the beggining to the end, along with all the problems we encountered, and how we solved them.

    \section{Development}
    \label{sec:development}

    The development of the Walking Aid System was tough for our team, to complete in time, as we lost valuable time at the beginning of the project while waiting for the proper equipment to arrive. Fortunately, we moved the project forward in both software and hardware development, developing prototypes. The loss of that time was something from which our timetable could never recover.
