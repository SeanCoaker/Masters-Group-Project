\chapter{Narrative and Reflective Account}
\label{ch:narrative}

    In this chapter we will provide a detailed narrative andd reflective account as well as a perspective on the entire process of developing the Walking Aid Usage Prompt System. Specifically, in this chapter we will describe all the development process, from the beggining to the end, along with all the problems we encountered, and how we solved them.

    \section{Requirements and Topic}
    \label{sec:reqs}

    The first thing we did was to arrange a meeting with the client, who in this case was a representative of Bangor Health Clinic. The reason for this meeting is to understand better the topic and also gather the requirements from the client. At first we thought of two possible outcomes, according to client's requirments, develop a wearable device or a non-wearable device. The first one being a device similar to a watch that will includes accelerometer, which will be responsible of calculating user's movement, and the second one being a pressure pad, that will detectes when the user is sitting or not to it. We chose the first solution rather than the second, as the second might need extra information to calculate the user's movement, for instance if the user stands up there is no way of understanding if the user is walking.

    \section{Development}
    \label{sec:development}

    The next step is the development of the proposed solution, including the methodology we followed. The development of the Walking Aid System was tough for our team, to complete in time, as we lost valuable time at the beginning of the project while waiting for the proper equipment to arrive. Fortunately, we moved the project forward in both software and hardware development, developing prototypes, after their arrival. The loss of that time was something from which our timetable could never recover. The development is split into two sections, the first section contains all the problems we encountered for the software development, and the second section contains all the problems we encountered for the hardware development.
