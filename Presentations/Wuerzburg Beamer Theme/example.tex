\frametitle{Initial Meeting with Client}
\begin{itemize}
\item Thursday 18th November.
\item Clarified and expanded project brief.
\item Discussed potential budget.
\item Identified 2 possible paths for final implementation.
\item Discussed possible stretch targets.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{The Two Options}
 \begin{itemize}
    \item A wearable device
    \item A non-wearable device
 \end{itemize}

  \begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
   \begin{block}{Wearable Device}
        Likely a watch that will include an accelerometer. The watch will detect when the patient is moving and should the second device on the walking aid not detect movement, a calming voice (family member) will remind the patient to use their walking aid. Downsides include needing to keep 2 devices charged, and patients/users disliking wearable devices. Upsides include allowing for the largest feature set.

  \end{minipage}

 \hover<3>{
  \begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
   \begin{block}{Non-Wearable Device}
        Likely a pressure pad that detects when the patient is no longer sitting/lying on the pad. Should the second device on the walking aid not detect movement within a time period of pressure not being detected on the pad, a calming voice (family member) will remind the patient to use their walking aid. Downsides include not being as portable, and likely confined to one location at once. Upsides include only needed to charge one device, ease of implementation and ease of integration into users lives.

\frametitle{Hardware Choices}
\begin{itemize}
\item Arduino.
\item TinyPICO devices using ESP32 chips (18mm x 32mm).
\item Accelerometers for wearables, pressure pads for non-wearables.
\item 3D Printed protoypes.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Next Steps}
\begin{itemize}
\item Meet with client again to finalise user requirements.
\item Begin developing milestone 1 document.
\item Procure hardware needed to develop the project using available funding of Â£150.
\end{itemize}
