\chapter{Project Definition}
\label{chap:proj-def}

In this chapter, we'll go through the Project in further depth. There will be a brief introduction to the Project's goals and services, as well as the solution that demonstrates how the entire system will operate. The evaluations that will be done will justify if the project functions normally, thus we will outline how we will assess the project.

\section{Context}

The challenge of this project is to develop an effective system that interacts with users, who are dementia patients. The reason we need to make an app like this is that dementia patients must be reminded to take their walking aid with them.


\section{Description of the Project}

This project will support the development of a wearable device including an application. The dementia patient or user will be encouraged to use the walking assistance in this application. A recorded message from a family member or relative will act as the notification. The device will detect if the user is sleeping and only then activate, since we do not want the device to begin notifying the user while he is sleeping, as the user might be startled by the notice.
