\chapter{Requirements} \label{ch:requirements}

    In this section, we will detail the project's functional and non-functional requirements, which are broken down into
    higher-level user requirements as well as lower-level specifications that will describe the process our team will go
    through to ensure the user requirements are met. These written requirements have been demonstrated to the client and they have provided their consent for the project to be based upon them.
