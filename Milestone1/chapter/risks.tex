\chapter{Risk Analysis}
	\label{chap:risk}

    Within this section, we will perform a risk analysis upon the proposed project by providing a list of possible risks associated. Along with the list of risks, we will provide mitigation strategies for said risks. Finally, we will provide a matrix which will be used to detail how likely a risk is to happen and how big of an impact that will risk will have on the project should it happen.
