\chapter{Risk Analysis}
	\label{ch:risk}

    Within this section, we will perform a risk analysis upon the proposed project by providing a list of possible risks that could negatively effect it. We will provide a list of these risks along with mitigation strategies that we will use to avoid the occurrence of said risks. Upon completion of the risk analysis, we will include a matrix demonstrating the likelihood of a risk occurring and the impact that risk could have on the project should it occur.
