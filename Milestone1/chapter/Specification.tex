In this chapter, we'll go through the project in further depth.
More specifically, we will outline a proposed solution as well as describing the
product.

\section{Description}

The challenge of this project is to develop an effective system that interacts
with users, who are dementia patients. The reason we need to make an app like
this is that dementia patients must be reminded to take their walking aid with them.
This project will support the development of a wearable device including an
application. The dementia patient or user will be encouraged to use the walking
assistance in this application. A recorded message from a family member or
relative will act as the notification. The device will detect if the user is
sleeping and only then activate, since we do not want the device to begin
notifying the user while he is sleeping, as the user might be startled by the notice.
